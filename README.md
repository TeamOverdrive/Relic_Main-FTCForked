### NOTICE
 
 This repo is deprecated since FTC will now be releasing each seasons SDK in its own repository.  <br>
 However this repo will remain unarchived.<br>
 The 2019-2020 Skystone season SDK can be found [here](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone "SkyStone SDK").<br>
 We will probably be using [OpenRC_turbo](https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenRC-turbo) as a base for future seasons as long as it remains maintained.<br>
